# Chu Ni Zi Mu
音游开字母辅助工具(Music Rhythm Game Title-Revealing Game Assistant)

## How to use
Just download the latest release and run it.  
**For ARM64 users: Due to the reason that JetBrains Rider hasn't supported to build for ARM64 platform using Native AOT, the ARM64 version of ChuNiZiMu is dependent on .NET 8 runtime. You need to install .NET 8 runtime before running ChuNiZiMu on ARM64 platform.**  

**For Qihoo 360 users: Although in fact that ChuNiZiMu contains no malicious code(s), sometimes Qihoo 360 may report ChuNiZiMu as a false-positively trojan virus. This may because of the .NET 8 native AOT compilation. You can add ChuNiZiMu to the white list of Qihoo 360 to solve this problem.**
